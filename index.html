  <h1> Multi Media RECAP </h1> 
  
  <p> Digital Audio </p>
  
  <p> Sound- a wave that is generated by an object vibrating in a medium such as air producing changes in pressure.  </p>
  <p> Waveform- sound is represented by a waveform that shows changes over time on a horizontal axis changes its pressure on the vertical axis. </p>

  <p> Properties of a sound wave: </p>
  
 <p> Wavelength - the distance between any point on a wave and the corresponding point on the wave.</p>
  
  <p> Amplitude - refers the distance between the highest and lowest point on a waveform. Determines volume or loudness. </p>

  <p> Frequency - refers to the number of complete cycles of a wave per unit of time. Its measured in hertz (Hz) </p>


  <p> Pitch - is related to frequency, the higher the frequency the higher the pitch same goes for lower sound.   </p>

<p> Digitizing Sound: digitizing entails 2 steps </p>
  
<li> sampling </li>
<li> quantizing </li>

  <img src="image/quanitizer.jpg" alt="sample">

  <p> sampling - the sound wave is sampled at a specific rate into discrete samples of amplitude values. The higher the rate the more accurate the data will be captured.  </p>

  <p> quantizing - each samples of amplitude values, will be mapped and rounded to the nearest value on a scale of discrete levels.  </p>
